This is a system that allows searching and visualizing lexical changes on douzens of thousands of Spanish words along the time, specifcally on the 1900-2009 range, using as data source semantic representations built with Google n-grams for Spanish (45 billion). The user searchs a word in time range (between 1 and N years) and the system returns the word sense for each year from the interval searched. The word's sense is represented by  the set of words that are the most similar in semantic and distributional terms. For example, the word “cancer“ was closely related in 1910 with “tuberculosis“ and “syphilis“ but in 1960 the closest words are “tumor“ and “carcinoma“.

The system's input is a data structure which has words related to other words using similarity degrees (Cosine) and the year. This data was generated using Natural Language Processing techniques and modules. Specifcally, we made the semantic process for more than 45 billion n-grams, availables after scanning more than 1 million from the “Google Books“ project. The semantic process is about transforming the n-grams in distributional “word-context“  matrixes. A matrix was generated for each year, where each word is a context array. Finally, the similarity amongst arrays (words) was calculated and, for each word, were selected the 20 more similar by year. Total, a data structure which more than 300 million was generated, and this is the demonstrator input.
